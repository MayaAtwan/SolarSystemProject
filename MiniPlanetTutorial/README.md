# Spaceship Simulation 🚀🌌🛰

<img src="res://readme.png" alt="Spaceship Simulation Project Overview" width="900" height="200">

This project is a spaceship simulation developed in Godot Engine. It features navigation and interaction within a dynamic solar system with multiple planets, each exerting gravitational influences. The spaceship supports local-axis rotation, thrust-based movement, and environmental forces like gravity and drag, with real-time HUD feedback. 🌍✨

## 🚀 Features

### Realistic Physics 🌌
- Simulates gravitational pull from multiple planets and drag effects near planetary atmospheres.

### Spaceship Control 🛰️
- **Rotation**: Rotate the spaceship along yaw, pitch, and roll axes relative to its local frame. 🔄
- **Thrust**: Accelerate forward or backward using thrust mechanics that deplete the spaceship’s fuel. ⛽

### Dynamic HUD Display 📊
Real-time display of key parameters, including:
- Fuel level. ⚡
- Gravity effect. 🌟
- Local rotation angles (yaw, pitch, roll). 🎛️

### Gravitational Simulation 🌠
Planets exert realistic gravitational forces based on distance and mass, affecting the spaceship's trajectory.
